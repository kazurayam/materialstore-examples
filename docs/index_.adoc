== Introduction

=== Background

Several years ago when I worked for an IT company, I endeavored to develop
automated UI tests for their Web applications.
I studied Selenium WebDriver in Java.
I studied the following article to learn how to take screenshots of web pages.

- https://www.guru99.com/take-screenshot-selenium-webdriver.html[Guru99, How to Take Screenshot in Selenium WebDriver]

I retyped their sample code. Here I will quote the entire source codes.

[source,java]
----
include::../src/test/java/guru99/selenium/screenshot/TakeScreenshotTest.java[]
----

When I ran this, the test produced a PNG image file in the `tmp` directory
under the project's root directory:

[source]
----
:~/github/materialstore-tutorial (master *+)
$ tree ./tmp
./tmp
└── test.png

0 directories, 1 file
----

The `test.png` image looked as this:

image:https://kazurayam.github.io/materialstore-tutorial/images/ch1/test.png[]

The code worked just fine.

=== Problem to solve

I wrote many Selenium tests that take bunches of screenshots.
During the course, I found several problems in the code shown above.

==== (1) I had to repeat writing code to create directories to store files

The Selenium library supports taking a screenshot of browser window
and saving image into a temporary file.
However, Selenium does not provide a mean of organizing the created files.
I had to write codes that create a directory structure to store the PNG files.

I ran a single test many times, and I wanted to preserve the outcomes
of 1st, 2nd and 3rd run.
So I need to create directories with name of timestamp format like
`20220414_093417`, `20220415_163924`, `20220416_170836` and so on.
I repeated inventing directory trees to store PNG files.
It was just tiring and boring.

The link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself[DRY] principle came up to me.
I wanted to invent a reusable library that manages a directory tree to
store screenshots created by my Selenium tests.

==== (2) Metadata of Web page disappeared

By executing the test, I got a file `./tmp/test.png`.
In fact the file was created out of a web page at the URL `http://demo.guru99.com/V4/`.
But the metadata (from which URL it was created,
at which stage of test processing it was created, etc)
is not recorded in the stored file.
Other program may read the file to reuse somehow, but it will never
be informed of the metadata that the `./tmp/test.png` file
was created out of the URL `http://demo.guru99.com/V4/`.

Without the metadata, screenshots are not reusable for any purposes.
Screenshots become garbage as soon as created.

==== (3) I had to repeat writing code to view stored files

When I got many PNG files on disk,
naturally I wanted a easy method to view images.
I wrote a code to generate an HTML report of PNG files.
I realised I should make the code as a reusable library.

==== (4) I wanted to compare 2 sets of screenshots of a single Web app

I developed a set of tests that take screenshots of web pages of
a single web app with 100% coverage.
Then I wanted to perform *Visual Inspection*:
compare the Development environment vs the Production environment;
compare the pages Before vs After a software update.

Sometimes I find unexpected visual differences between the two sets.
The report of comparison becomes the best checklist for me
to improve the quality of software.

=== Solution by Materialstore

==== Sample code

The following code is a JUnit5-based test in Java,
which performs the following:

1. it opens Chrome browser, navigates to `https://www.google.com`
2. in the `<input type="text" name="q">` field, type a query string, take a screenshot and save the PNG image into the `store` directory.
3. and do SEND; wait for the respnse; take anothr screenshot and save it into the `store` directory
4. compile a HTML report that renders the 2 PNG files with the metadata (URL etc)

[source,java]
----
include::../src/test/java/com/kazurayam/materialstore/tutorial/ch1/GoogleSearchTest.java[]
----

When I ran the test, it creates a directory named `store` under the
project's directory where a tree of directories/files are created.

----
:~/github/materialstore-tutorial (master *+)
$ tree ./build/tmp/testOutput
./build/tmp/testOutput
└── com.kazurayam.materialstore.tutorial.ch1.GoogleSearchTest
    └── store
        ├── GoogleSearch
        │   └── 20220415_224026
        │       ├── index
        │       └── objects
        │           ├── a7a5c13181ccadc1502bd325df2fa43d6a58a5be.png
        │           └── fe165e0a3a4577caa0c5756a526b3fc320e0b64e.png
        └── GoogleSearch-list.html

5 directories, 4 files
----

The `store/GoogleSearch/yyyyMMdd_hhmmss/index` file would be interesting.
Its content is something like this:

[source]
----
include::testOutput/com.kazurayam.materialstore.tutorial.ch1.GoogleSearchTest/store/GoogleSearch/20220415_224848/index[]
----

Please note that the `index` file contains the *Metadata*: the URL out of which
screenshots are taken, and the fact that I made a query for "Shohei Ohtani" to Google.

The test generated a HTML
